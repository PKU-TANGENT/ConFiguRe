# ConFiguRe: Exploring Discourse-level Chinese Figures of Speech

This repository presents the dataset and baseline implementation for the COLING 2022 long paper (oral): "ConFiguRe: Exploring Discourse-level Chinese Figures of Speech".

## Overview

ConFiguRe is a Chinese corpus for Contextualized Figure Recognition concerning 12 commonly used rhetoric figures. It involves both extracting a figurative unit from the discourse-level context and classifying this unit into the right figure type. On the basis of ConFiguRe, three tasks are devised as benchmarks, i.e. *figure extraction*, *figure type classification* and *figure recognition*.

## ConFiguRe Dataset
